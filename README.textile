h2. git-wtf

A useful script that displays local & remote branches, what are in sync and what need merging,
and so on, like so:

<pre>Local branch: heads/master
[x] in sync with remote

Remote branch: origin/master (git@github.com:account/project.git)
[x] in sync with local

Feature branches:
[x] ticket_827 is merged in
[ ] ticket_831 is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead; 18 commits behind)
    - [dependencies] Depend on library X, version Y [bfda321]</pre>

h3. Installation

<code>$ make git-alias</code>

<code>$ make git-sh-alias</code>
(makes <code>master!repo> wtf</code> work in git-sh:http://github.com/rtomayko/git-sh/ console

or just:

<code>$ make</code>
to perform both actions.

Then:
<code>sudo make install</code>
